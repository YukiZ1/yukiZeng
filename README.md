### [Project 1: Grokking moment of LLM – Interpretation of LLM](https://github.com/YukiZ1/grokking_paper_reproduction)
**Description:** This project reproduces the **"Grokking"** phenomenon in Transformer model on a simple task.
- **Custom Transformer Architecture:** Deeply understand the structure of Transformer model and mannually implement the model
- **Visualization:** Upskilling and implement to **Hook** function to drill down to a single layer in a complex model. And plot the neuron output for pattern recognition.

### [Project 2: Binary Prediction of Smoking Status through Bio-Signals – Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e24/overview)
**Description:** This project develops a machine learning model to predict an individual's smoking status. My team is 'yuqiZeng1999'.
- **Data Source:** Bio-signals data
- **Model Selection:** XGBoost, LightGBM
- **Results:** Reached 87 of the AUC score at the private dataset
- **interpretability tools:** LIME, SHAP 

### [Project 3: Attention and Sentiment Changes of Chinese and American Netizens towards the Pandemic](https://github.com/YukiZ1/Attention-and-Sentiment-Changes-of-Chinese-and-American-Netizens-towards-the-Pandemic)
**Description:** This project employed Decision Trees, Naive Bayes and BERT models for classification, and conducted LDA for nuanced topic clustering.
- **Data Source:** data crawled from Weibo and Twitter(X)
- **Model Selection:** BERT, LDA

### [Project 1: Consumer Repurchase Prediction in Online Retail (bachelor thesis)](https://github.com/YukiZ1/Consumer-Repurchase-Prediction-in-Online-Retail)
**Description:** This project analyzes purchase data from "JD.com" to predict repurchase behavior, concludes the most important feature influencing repurchase and provides recommendations to improve repurchase rate.
- **Data Source:** "JD.com" purchase data
- **Analysis Methods:** Feature engineering, XGBoost
- **Results:** Achieved an AUC score of 77, identified key features and provided optimization suggestions

### [Project 2: Statistical Exploration of Thermophysical Characteristics in Cheese](https://github.com/YukiZ1/CheeseAnalysis)
**Description:** This project mainly discusses whether thermophysical properties differ by texture, how many distinct cheese varieties exist based on these measurements, and whether texture can be predicted from them. The results support the use of thermophysical measurements for distinguishing textures, identifying cheese varieties, and classifying new samples, valuable tools for quality control and product development.
- **Data Source:** 89 cheese samples
- **Analysis Methods:** MANOVA, PCA, K-Means, LDA (R code)
- **Results:** MANOVA confirmed significant differences among textures, except between Pasta Filata and Soft. Clustering techniques consistently identified three natural cheese varieties. Linear Discriminant Analysis achieved 100 percent classification accuracy.

### [Project 3: Data-Driven House Price Prediction](https://github.com/YukiZ1/Data-Driven-House-Price-prediction)
**Description:** Built and compared **regularized regression** and **XGBoost** models to predict house prices. XGBoost achieved the best performance with the lowest RMSE. And results were presented to stakeholders.

- **Data Source:** 279 house samples from three neighborhoods, 38-feature dataset with multicollinearity 
- **Analysis Methods:** Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Elastic Net, XGBoost
- **Results:** XGBoost achieved **RMSE = 24604.36, PRMSE = 15.57%, R^2 = 0.87**; And identified top predictors (Overall Quality, Ground Living Area, House Age) using variable importance plots.
