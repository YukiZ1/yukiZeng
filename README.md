### [Project 1: Consumer Repurchase Prediction in Online Retail (bachelor thesis)](https://github.com/YukiZ1/Consumer-Repurchase-Prediction-in-Online-Retail)
**Description:** This project analyzes purchase data from "JD.com" to predict repurchase behavior, concludes the most important feature influencing repurchase and provides recommendations to improve repurchase rate.
- **Data Source:** "JD.com" purchase data
- **Analysis Methods:** Feature engineering, XGBoost
- **Results:** Achieved an AUC score of 77, identified key features and provided optimization suggestions

### [Project 2: Statistical Exploration of Thermophysical Characteristics in Cheese](https://github.com/YukiZ1/CheeseAnalysis)
**Description:** This project mainly discusses whether thermophysical properties differ by texture, how many distinct cheese varieties exist based on these measurements, and whether texture can be predicted from them. The results support the use of thermophysical measurements for distinguishing textures, identifying cheese varieties, and classifying new samples, valuable tools for quality control and product development.
- **Data Source:** 89 cheese samples
- **Analysis Methods:** MANOVA, PCA, K-Means, LDA (R code)
- **Results:** MANOVA confirmed significant differences among textures, except between Pasta Filata and Soft. Clustering techniques consistently identified three natural cheese varieties. Linear Discriminant Analysis achieved 100 percent classification accuracy.
